# Aletrly

**Aletrly â€“ Innovation that Amplifies the Citizens' Voice**  
Aletrly revolutionizes the dialogue between citizens and public administrations. Through a simple and accessible platform, citizens can report issues and share their experiences. Public administrations, empowered by cutting-edge AI, gain real-time insights into the most pressing concerns, allowing them to act quickly and effectively to address problems.

### Technology serving the common good  
Aletrly harnesses the power of **Llama 3.1** running on **Groq** for high-performance, precise responses. With the integration of **LlamaIndex**, the platform implements **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, which queries an SQL database containing all citizen reports. When public administrations ask a question, the AI searches the database, gathering and combining the relevant information to deliver accurate and actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making.

With Aletrly, artificial intelligence is not just about technological innovation but becomes a practical tool for improving the lives of citizens, creating a more efficient, participatory, and responsive city ready to tackle future challenges.
